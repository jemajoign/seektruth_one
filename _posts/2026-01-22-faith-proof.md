Apparently, some people think it would be a good idea to prove the efficacy of intercessory prayer by subjecting it to clinical trial -- so much for "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test." As one large, triple-blind, and expensive ($2.4 million) study concluded, "Intercessory prayer itself had no effect on complication-free recovery from CABG, but certainty of receiving intercessory prayer was associated with a higher incidence of complications."[^1] In other words, they found, while prayers you do not know about have no effect, prayers that you do know about have a reverse effect (perhaps due to performance anxiety)!

Imagine that they found a 20% greater likelihood of recovery through intercessory prayer. There would still be many problems. To start with, what about the other 80%? What does that say about God? Even more significantly, God appears to be merely *helping out* in these studies, providing some extra boost to what is otherwise a natural process of recovery. If we were going to put God to the test, why not have him do something truly exceptional so as to prove himself beyond doubt? That is what Sam Harris suggested in a 2007 debate with Rick Warren:
> You could prove to the satisfaction of every scientist that intercessory prayer works if you set up a simple experiment. Get a billion Christians to pray for a single amputee. Get them to pray that God regrow that missing limb. This happens to salamanders every day, presumably without prayer; this is within the capacity of God. I find it interesting that people of faith only tend to pray for conditions that are self-limiting.[^2]

These problems arise from a misunderstanding of what prayer is and of who God is. In a typical experiment, one sets up the proper conditions to stimulate a reaction and then measures the reaction. By carefully ruling out other contributing factors as much as possible, the scientist establishes causation or at least correlation. Thus, I apply heat to water, measure its temperature, and then measure the amount of steam that is produced. In the case of God, however, what would be that proper setup to stimulate the miracle? The experimenters and all the Christian churches that participated in these studies assumed that it is intercessory prayer. In so doing, they perhaps unwittingly acted as though God were a cosmic force that manifests under certain conditions. These studies are initiated by those who believe that reality must be experimentally verifiable. When someone reports a miracle, such persons are skeptical and will want to replicate the results before they give it any credence. On the other hand, believers too may want to provide some indisputable proof to the modern age, and to do so requires a carefully set up miracle. But this is precisely the point, there is no setup that will reproduce it. *A miracle is not replicable.* If we could replicate it, it would not be a miracle. It would be nature.

So, the miracle is real but not replicable. It is real but not experimentally verifiable. Is this strange? Only those who need reality to contort itself to fit the methodology of natural science would find it strange. After all, even within the sciences, experimental verifiability is only one kind of method and the certainty attained by it is only one kind of certainty, and they are not intrinsically better or worse than the others.

## Certainties in the Formal, Natural, and Social Sciences

### Math is Obvious
In mathematics (or the "formal sciences" in general), it is possible to *prove* theorems. Given a set of axioms, you draw conclusions from them that will thereafter be known with perfect certainty. To take an extremely simple and silly example, we will show that if you have an odd number of ducks, say $N$ ducks, and they each have $N$ ducklings, the total number of ducklings ($N \times N$) will also be odd.

Positive odd numbers are 1, 3, 5,... This is equivalent to $2 \times 0 + 1, 2 \times 1 + 1, 2 \times 2 + 1$,... Therefore, an odd number $N$ is $2k+1$ for some positive integer $k$ -- that is -- every positive odd number is one greater than 0 or some positive even number. Since we know that $N=2k+1$, we know that we have $2k+1$ ducks and each duck has $2k+1$ ducklings. $N \times N = (2k+1) \times (2k+1) = (2k \times 2k) + (2k \times 1) + (1 \times 2k) + (1 \times 1) = 4k^2 + 4k + 1$. The two terms on the left ($4k^2 + 4k)$ happen to be divisible by two. If we pull the 2 out, we get $2(2k^2 + 2k)+1$. Notice that $(2k^2 + 2k)$ must be a positive integer, since it involves only the multiplication and addition of positive integers. Suppose we call it $m$, where $m = 2k^2 + 2k$. Now our number of ducks is $N \times N = 2m+1$. This is in fact the very definition of an odd number (i.e. it is one greater than the even number $2m$). Therefore, we know with *certainty* that, given the contrived scenario above, there will be an odd number of ducklings.

This kind of provable certainty is only possible in the formal sciences, such as math and logic. The theorem that is being proved is in fact a mere representation of the original axioms in different words. Proofs are just a matter of thinking through what was already implied from the beginning. Let us think about how $N \times N$ being odd was already implied from the beginning. 

When you try to divide an odd number in two, there will always be one outlier, like so.

![2k+1]({{ site.media }}./2k+1.png)

The last item is the odd one out, so to speak. If you have an odd number of copies of this group, there will be an odd number of odd ones out, like so:

![(2k+1)x(2k+1)]({{ site.media }}./(2k+1) x (2k+1).png)

$N \times N$ means having $N$ copies of the even parts and $N$ copies of the odd ones out. The even parts are all even and so can be ignored, but when you count the odd ones out, you get $N$, which we already know to be an odd number. This is all remarkably obvious. In fact, everything in math, even the most complicated proof in the world, is just as obvious in principle. The problem is that it is not at all obvious until we see how obvious it is. And one may not see how obvious it is, for example that $N \times N$ conserves parity, until one thinks about it sufficiently. This leads to the apocryphal joke, told with ever-changing characters:

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" data-embed-height="320"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/8bisfd/comment/dx76blr/">Comment</a><br> by<a href=""></a> from discussion<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/8bisfd/is_it_just_me_or_does_the_mathematicians_desire/"></a><br> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/">math</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

This special kind of certainty, while quite beautiful in its proper domain, is an impossible standard for the other classes of science, as we will see below.

### Natural Science is Not False (Yet)
Some people have a field day whenever a prominent scientific theory is disproven. There is a fleeting sense of satisfaction in knowing that even the smart people get stuff wrong. Science can after all be rather intimidating. Everyone is seeking life's ultimate explanation, and any group that claims to have a monopoly over that enterprise -- whether through religion, science, philosophy, self-help, or in any other way -- is looked at with fear and suspicion. Science, in its essence, however is unique from the other fields. While individual scientists may be just as egotistical as the next intellectual, science as a whole prides itself on its [falsifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability). A claim is not considered scientific unless it can be disproven by an empirical observation. The beauty of this methodology is that anyone can make a scientific claim and anyone else can attempt to disprove it. Over time, this leads to an edifice of knowledge that consists of time-tested theories that have been the most resilient against all attempts to disprove them. The fact that they cannot be overturned suggests that they are the most adequated to the structure of reality. For example, you could attempt to disprove the second law of thermodynamics (entropy) by joining the ranks of countless inventors who have attempted to create a [perpetual motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion) machine over the last one thousand years.

The natural sciences cannot attain the kind of certainty that we see in mathematics. We do not have access to the underlying axioms of the universe. We cannot sit around deriving "obvious" truths that are already implicit in our *a priori* knowledge. Rather, the universe surprises us in careful observation, and it sends us back to the drawing board over and over again. Yet, the careful work of the last few centuries has paid off. We successfully *approximate* certainty to such a high degree that we bet our lives on it everyday (e.g. when we travel in cars, take an Advil, or sit calmly at our desk on the 25th floor of a building).

### History *Never* Repeats Itself
The social sciences, unlike the formal and natural sciences, are complicated because they deal with human beings. In some limited sense, they too are falsifiable. For example, a psychologist may publish a paper about how subliminal images influence behavior, and this can be disproven by an experiment involving a large enough sample size. The challenge is that two experiments are never really equivalent. The 1000 people used in the first experiment and the 1000 people used in the disproving experiment could be statistically different. Even if the best measures are taken to have a diverse range of participants, at the very least, 1000 people today are necessarily different (in preferences, common knowledge, etc) from 1000 people 10 years ago. Also, anyone who has conducted an experiment with people (even conducting a survey) knows that quantitative data is often a gross reduction of a many-dimensional problem. (For example, people may rate a course higher because they like the teacher even if they did not learn much.)Experimenters try to resolve this dilemma using qualitative data, but they often end up with quantitative data + anecdotes.

If this challenge is present in psychology, it is all the more present in history. Despite recurring patterns and analogies we draw from contemporaneous experience, history can never be repeated. We cannot verify a theory by empirical observation because the events of the past are no longer at our disposal. We cannot re-run the fall of the Roman Empire thousands of times, tweaking its variables on each iteration, to finally determine whether it was caused by moral decadence or by Christianity, by climate change or by taxes. With psychology, there is at least some hope of conducting a truly objective experiment, but not with history. Is history therefore outside the realm of truth? Is it relegated to the world of subjectivism and fantasy? Of course not. It simply has a different method of converging upon truth and a different kind of resultant certainty. As it turns out, history is one of the most important fields of science, insofar as we learn from our mistakes and build upon the work of those before us. It cannot and should not, therefore, be subject to the standards of certainty employed by the formal and natural sciences. It has its own way of bringing truth to us.

## Faith is a Road Never Traveled Before
When a couple who has been married for 25 years recounts their love story, we do not assess its value as truth based on its replicability. In fact, its authenticity as a genuine love story partly depends on its uniqueness and *lack* of replicability. If a person found their partner in a marriage marketplace, the economic predictability of the outcomes would oppose the mystery of love. This is not just the case with love, but with an individual's experience of raising their children, of starting a non-profit, or of surviving cancer. Human life never crosses the same path twice. This is why, as much as people desperately search through videos and books that tell you "exactly what to do," raising children well or making a marriage work never comes easy. The specific, challenging scenarios one is met with on the road of life have never occurred before, and there is no book or human being who can claim to know exactly what you should do.

This "unique path" character is evident in everyday life because of the countless factors involved in any sequence of real events. It is, however, especially evident in the interior life, in one's spiritual journey. The infinitesimal, interior movements and the vast differences of inner perception between individuals make it impossible for there to be any replicable spiritual path, except in the most general terms. Each spiritual path is unique. Moreover, the ways in which God reveals himself to each individual is also different owing to his infinitude, the unique capacities of each person to reflect aspects of his divinity as *imago Dei*, and the freedom and mystery of his activity in general. 

With all this being the case, what emanates from the human heart in prayer, what unfolds in the dynamism of each person's relationship with God, the manner in which God acts in time, and the mystery of how he infuses history with his peaceful and salvific reign, escape every form of predictability conceivable. If the most gifted artists and intellectuals in history are known for their consistent originality, how much more is this the case with God, whose "\[mercies\] are new every morning" (Lam 3:23). The harmonies across his works are observed after the fact and are causes of our amazement but never of our mastery over him. For these reasons, faith is the antithesis of monotony. It is a personal commitment to follow his lead, as one man trusts another with his very life. It is setting out into the unknown, into the ever-greater, with only the assurance of his real presence, alongside us and ahead of us, and the firm conviction of his good will towards us. When we are enmeshed in the quagmire of the predictable, he transfigures our limited perception, overwhelms our capacities, and invites us to the journey of faith, saying, "Rise up, and do not be afraid" (Matt 17:7).
