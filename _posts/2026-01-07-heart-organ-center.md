## The heart in pre-modernity
The heart is the organ that circulates oxygen-equipped blood cells from the lungs to the other cells of the body. As William Harvey (d. 1657) first observed, the heart is literally a pump, a description embraced and popularized by Descartes. Why has this very mechanical organ, of all the human organs, been used to represent the spiritual depths of the human person?

Our ancestors saw the heart as the seat of emotions, intelligence, and the soul. Today, we comfortably employ what they have written about the heart as though they were speaking as metaphorically as we do. A quick look at what Aristotle said about the heart will prove otherwise.
> These writers... see also that the brain is the most peculiar of all the animal organs; and out of these facts they form an argument, by which they link sensation and brain together. It has, however, already been clearly set forth in the treatise on Sensation, that it is the region of the heart that constitutes the sensory centre.[^1]

He was not speaking metaphorically. He believed that the heart, the physical organ, was the seat of the soul, intelligence, motion, and sensation (and the brain was meant for cooling purposes). But it is not just Aristotle. Most thinkers down through the ages and across disparate cultures saw the heart as the spiritual and vital center of the human being. (Hippocrates[^2] was a notable exception, though not the only one). The Egyptian Book of the Dead of Hunefer (c. 1275 BC) describes the "weighing of the heart" as the form of final judgment. The image below depicts a man's heart being weighed on a balance. On the other end of the scale is a feather that represents truth, justice, and order. If his heart is too heavy from evil, he will be devoured by the crocodile-headed beast and doomed for all eternity. If his heart is pure and light, he will enter the heavenly paradise.

The Chinese believed that [Xin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xin_(heart-mind)) (the heart) was the source of feelings and thoughts. The same was true in India ([hṛdaya](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%AF#Sanskrit:_heart:~:text=%5Bedit%5D-,%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%91%E0%A4%AF%20%E2%80%A2%20(h%E1%B9%9B%CC%81daya),-stem%2C%C2%A0n)). While the Hebrew word "lēḇ" does not point to a specific organ, it generally follows suit by highlighting the 'heart area' in general. In the Hebrew Scriptures, "Often lēḇ serves in the absence of a Hebrew word for 'breast' or 'chest'... The lēḇ functions in all dimensions of human existence and is used as a term for all the aspects of a person: vital, affective, noetic, and voluntative."[^3]

## Why the heart?
The choice of the heart across so many cultures must have a reason. Indeed, the heart has special characteristics. It is amazing, for example, how quickly your heart speeds up when you are met with a threat. Your heart jumps before you even *realize* that you are in danger. Fear, like all emotions, is a "multidimensional" reaction to the environment (or to automatic thoughts) that often precede conscious awareness. One of those "dimensions" is your heart rate. In fact, your heart rate can clue you in to how you are feeling. Someone says something that makes you angry, your heart rate soars, and *then* you notice that your heart is pounding and that you need to calm down. Pulse is easily noticeable and reveals much about how we are feeling. No wonder people use the expression, "I want to feel the pulse of the situation." And it is also no wonder why the heart became associated with the seat of our emotions, deepest feelings, and conscience.

Of course, there are many other "dimensions" to emotional reactions than cardiac activity. Facial expression, for example, is a powerful indicator of emotion. However, a given facial expression may be the product of the autonomic nervous system (unconscious behavior) just as much as of the somatic nervous system (e.g., ordinary affectation). I may smile, even to myself, though I do not feel happy because I want to feel happy or I am supposed to feel happy. That is not possible with the heart, which is why polygraphs are quite effective even on people who can keep a straight face while lying. If a person is in love, even if she does not want to be in love, her heart remains honest with her. If a person is excited, his heart beats faster, even if he tries to appear cool and collected.

Clearly then, the heart stands out among all the organs as the most representative and truthful expression of what one is feeling. It is understandable therefore how it was supposed to be the origin or seat of emotions, morality, decisions, and even thought. 

## The fine resolution of the heart
Is your heart pounding like a drum? Or is it flowing easily up and down with your breathing? This tells you whether your heart is under the reigns of your sympathetic nervous system (SNS - i.e. fight or flight system) or your parasympathetic nervous system (PNS - i.e. rest and digest system). But what is even more incredible is the fine-grained resolution of these systems in their control of the heart. The SNS does not just kick in when you are under threat but *each and every time you breathe in*! Ordinarily, when you are not under stress, the PNS sends a constant "take it easy" signal to your heart's internal pacemaker (Sinoatrial node). But when you breathe in, receptors in your lungs notify the brain stem, which immediately inhibits this calming effect of the PNS. What results is a mild fight or flight response, triggering the rapid pumping of blood while you are breathing in. It turns out we get triggered pretty easily, with every breath!

An electrocardiogram records the electrical signals of the heart's internal pacemaker. The spikes in the following image capture the main pumping action that we refer to as our heart beat or pulse.

![ECG]({{ site.media }}./ecg.png)
*Figure 1 - ECG*

Looking closely, you will see that the spacing between the peeks varies. The time between them is less during inhalation and greater during exhalation. If you assign a time to each heart beat based on the time lapsed since the previous heart beat, you will see a curve that moves up and down quite nicely like this.

![RR Intervals]({{ site.media }}./rr_intervals.png)
*Figure 2 - Intervals between heart beats*

In this graph, the peaks are when the heart is pumping most slowly (i.e. long gaps between heart beats). It usually occurs at some point while breathing out or while holding one's breath. Interestingly, when you first hold your breath, your heart beat intervals get longer as expected, but after a few seconds, you experience an asphyxiation reflex and your SNS initiates a faster heart beat. If you follow a breathing pattern such as the Weil method (also called "4-7-8": inhale for 4 seconds/counts, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds), you may notice the asphyxiation reflex after holding your breath for just a few seconds. This SNS activation from asphyxiation subsides as soon as you start to release your breath because exhalation activates the PNS. In our way of plotting the intervals, this may appear as a dip in the middle of the otherwise rising interval durations. Notice the M like shape that can occur due to this dip.

![RR Intervals with holding breath]({{ site.media }}./4-7-8_rr.png)
*Figure 3 - Intervals between heart beats overlaid with a fitted curve*

**Note:** the red line is a periodic, fitted curve to show the remarkable rhythmicity of the heart during a breathing pattern. This wave can be expressed approximately as 
$r(n)=r_0-\frac{2}{3} s \cdot sin(\frac{2 \pi n}{P})+s \cdot cos(\frac{4 \pi n}{P})$, where $r_0$ is the average interval between heart beats, $P$ is the number of heart beats per respiratory cycle, $s$ is some scaling factor (in this case about 100), and $n$ is the variable representing the beat number (not time). Curves will of course look differently for different people and at different times/situations even when following the same breathing pattern. For certain people, (1) the asphyxiation reflex may dip lower and (2) the exhalation peak may climb higher than the holding-breath-peak. These two facets can be modeled by (1) adding an inversely signed first-order sine wave and (2) phase-shifting the original first order sine wave. It could be represented simply by: $r(n)=r_0-\frac{2}{3} s \cdot sin(\frac{2 \pi (n-2)}{P})+\frac{1}{3} s \cdot sin(\frac{2 \pi n}{P})+s \cdot cos(\frac{4 \pi n}{P})$.

## The bilateral arrangement between your heart and your emotions
So far we have spoken about the heart as the bellwether of one's emotions. The relationship is more complex. Just as the heart rate is partly a symptom of the level of one's fear or excitement, one's fear or excitement is also partly a symptom of one's heart rate. This likely happens through interoception. Your brain senses your heart rate and adjusts your felt emotional state. Reducing one's heart rate therefore leads to greater emotional calm.[^4]

SNS activation causes your heart to pump at a steady and rapid rate. This is the thumping people experience when they stand before a large audience, for example. The goal is to change this, but we do not have direct control over our heart rate. We therefore take advantage of the close connection between breathing and heart rate described above. Notice how perfectly the heart rate moves in Figure 3 over the course of *~100 heart beats*, so much so that it can be represented by summing a few basic wave equations. Breathing practices like the Weil method, deep breathing, pranayama, and many others aim to bring control to your breath: Control your breathing -> lower your heart rate -> reduce your anxiety. 

By longer periods of exhalation, you introduce variability into your heart rate. You cause the peaks on the interval graphs to go higher (i.e. more time between beats). Notice how in figure 2 the interval moves from ~650 milliseconds (which would equal 92 beats per minute if continuous) all the way to 1150 milliseconds (52 bpm). After a long exhale, you take in a deep breath, causing the intervals between successive beats to rapidly decrease, and the cycle repeats. This up-and-down elasticity of the heart rate is called HRV (heart rate variation - typically measured by the root mean squared of the differences between successive intervals). Because the SNS pumps the heart like a steady drum, there is typically little variation during periods of stress. In fact, *lower HRV is strongly correlated with higher anxiety.* A meta-analysis found that "Panic disorder (n = 447), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 192), generalized anxiety disorder (n = 68), and social anxiety disorder (n = 90), but not obsessive–compulsive disorder (n = 40), displayed reductions in HF HRV relative to controls (all ps < 0.001)."[^5] Through deep breathing or other methods, we aim to increase our HRV and so come to feel less anxious.

## Conclusion (for now)
Descartes was not wrong but neither was he right. The heart *would have* been a mere pump were it for the unimaginably intricate interconnectivity of the body. The body is a unity, and every organ within it is more than it is by itself. The heart in particular is tightly bound with man's emotional state and both his conscious and unconscious feelings and desires. It is therefore an apt symbol for his interiority, for the depths of his being that evade his own understanding. 

Our ancestors may not have understood much about the heart or the brain at a biological level, but we are indebted to them for their rich reflections about our interior being. The heart gave them a way to name, address, and confront these deepest aspects of ourselves that make us truly human. Whenever we are moved by love, pierced by beauty, or touched by God, there is a definite way in which we *feel* this in the center of our embodied existence, in our hearts. In this way, the heart points us ever-inward, beyond our visible and social existence, where we lay somehow beyond ourselves through the image and presence of Christ within.

> The heart is the dwelling-place where I am, where I live; according to the Semitic or Biblical expression, the heart is the place "to which I withdraw." The heart is our hidden center, beyond the grasp of our reason and of others; only the Spirit of God can fathom the human heart and know it fully. The heart is the place of decision, deeper than our psychic drives. It is the place of truth, where we choose life or death. It is the place of encounter, because as image of God we live in relation: it is the place of covenant.[^6]
