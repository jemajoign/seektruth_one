## Where intuition and intellection fail us
“I see no hope for the future of our people if they are dependent on the frivolous youth of today…” (Hesiod, 700 BC). Throughout history, many intelligent people have intuited that the world is going to hell in a handbasket, that young people are immoral, and that society has a whole has lost its moral sense. Sometimes people will buffer such a sentiment with hope concerning a small subset of the population that is swimming against the tide, but even then the general sense is that the world at large is crumbling. Of course, if this were true, the human race would have been in continuous decline, and our hunter-gatherer ancestors must have been saints. Forgetting about pre-historic man, even in the last 3000 years of Judeo-Christianity, it cannot be argued that we have been in moral decline. To cite just a few examples of progress, we no longer have cult prostitution in our places of worship (2 Kings 23:7), socially acceptable and widespread slavery, concubinages for men of wealth and power, and the burning alive of people with different beliefs or views.

This is just one example of where intuition can fail us even though intuition is a powerful gift. A thorough and honest look at the data would never support such a claim.  This tendency to project an overarching meaning on to reality that is not grounded in the reality itself perhaps comes from:
* the need for coherence - I experience great discomfort when reality fails to make sense or meet my expectations and this makes me anxious or angry. I experience a compulsion to re-establish coherence as soon as possible. Sometimes I achieve this by condemning reality so that I can find myself or my group safely above it.
* flippancy, sensationalism, a general lack of concern with accuracy - This is how old wives' tales and certain contemporary health trends get passed along, for example. Even systematically disproving them would be of no avail in stemming their spread because they are immune to reason by design.

A different but related problem comes from jumping from idea to idea, falling deeper and deeper into speculation, and becoming increasingly alienated from reality. Tremendous intellectual power is misapplied in speculation because of its appeal to some of the brightest minds. To make matters worse, the novelty of speculation wins audiences, reinforcing this tendency. For listeners, speculative orations feed their curiosity (*Neugier* in German -- literally, greed for new things) like nothing else can because it moves at lightning speed, unfettered by the nuances and contraints of reality. 

## Where decontruction becomes destructive
On the other end of the spectrum, we find the tendency to deconstruct matters to their most basic parts and then to try to make sense of reality from these fragments. This has advantages over the aforementioned tendencies because it is disciplined and thorough and grounded in the reality itself. The problem is that the matters we are trying to discover in the depths of reality will mysteriously slip by us while we are still rigorously drilling into them. A man was so curious about *time* that he pulled apart a clock to examine every one of its gears. In the end,he understood the clock entirely, from the ground up, but he knew nothing more about time. As he meticulously delineated every feature of its most irreducible gears, he forgot what he set out to find in the first place. People try to make sense of their health by subjecting themselves to a never-ending series of tests and diagnoses, following an increasingly more complex and expensive medicinal regimen, while their illnesses keep evading their grasp and reappearing in new forms. The problem here is *not seeing the forest for the trees*. Deconstruction becomes destructive whenever it is reductive. 

## Zeitgeist - an example of the whole
Almost all statements that include "Gen Z is..." are hasty generalizations (not this one!). And yet, there really is such a thing as Gen Z. There really is "society nowadays," even while most of our statements about it do not capture it. The media cult follows fads that fade as quickly as they rise and altogether lack import. Meanwhile, social researchers get lost in statistics, which is the wrong instrument for measuring the Zeitgeist (the *spirit* of the times). Even an individual's spirit cannot be measured in questionnaires, since the individual never leaves feeling that his answers captured the nuances of his experience. Think of a simple question like "How happy are you?" If statistics cannot approach the spirit of an individual, much less can it attain the spirit of the times and of billions of people. On the other hand, scientific researchers believe they can explain the times unilaterally through game theory or genetics or hormones. Is there anybody out there who gets it, who sees the whole, who truly senses the spirit?

In 1988, Pope St. John Paul II wrote: 

> Science can purify religion from error and superstition; religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes. Each can draw the other into a wider world, a world in which both can flourish.[^99]

He strikes me as someone who *saw* something: where things stood, where they could end up. Or as Mother Teresa, understanding the hearts of people today so deeply, would say, “The most terrible poverty is loneliness, and the feeling of being unloved.”

## The science of zooming in, the art of zooming out
We must appreciate the scientific enterprise, inasmuch as it saved us from unbounded speculation and hasty generalizations. Whether we are involved in science itself or not, we should learn from it. Its patient, methodic, falsification-bounded crawl to the truth is something we can all learn from. The *science of zooming in* is about isolating variables, controlling for other factors, and rigorous testing. As John Paul II wrote above, Christians could learn a lot from this. Instead of making hasty generalizations about the origins and remedies of anxiety or about jealousy or shame, they should first carefully zoom in to the phenomena. If they did, they would almost immediately notice that these are each present in other animals as well, and they would be careful to build upon these animal foundations. (As it stands, many of the explanations out there are so lofty that they inadvertently ascribe a spiritual character to animals.) Zooming in requires the patience of small steps and the humility of following the evidence, often despite the urgent need for coherence.

A researcher may be knee-deep in a difficult problem when he is called away from his desk. Everyone knows that just getting up, stepping away, perhaps stepping outside, and physically seeing a wider view can provide fresh perspective on any problem. Sometimes a bit of music can make the world change. Life looks different with headphones on, like when you watch all the people flurrying about the airport while listening to Louis Armstrong singing "[What A Wonderful World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nGKqH26xlg)" -- it's just different. The music colors the experience, or rather, it accentuates a deeper aspect of reality that is forgotten in the daily commotion. Indeed, artists are especially gifted in capturing these deep aspects, the whole, or the Zeitgeist, typically through an intuitive and pre-reflective genius. Their works help us scale the heights of Being, if but for a moment, and to see the big picture. Beauty, nature, music, art -- these are all helpful for "zooming out" -- as are interactions with loved ones and children. They snap us out of a rabid fixation that had perhaps lost sight of its purpose a long time ago. Nothing zooms out more elegantly than daily contemplative prayer, in which the Holy Spirit lets us share in the Mind of Christ and even reveals to us the unfathomable depths of God.

Jolly recently visited St. Bavo's Cathedral in Belgium recently, and shared a breathtaking photo of [The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent_Altarpiece) by Hubert and Jan Van Eyck from 1432. Just one aspect of the masterpiece, Adam's eyes, in one instant of intuition, can tell us more about the heart of man than reading copious amounts of anthropological literature.
