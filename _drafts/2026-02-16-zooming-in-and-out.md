## It's hard to see the big picture
When we are trying to make sense of something, there are two opposing tendencies. On the one hand, we rely too much on intuition and make *hasty generalizations*, like, "The modern world is too consumeristic to care about religion." Hasty generalizations can come from:
* the need for coherence - I experience great discomfort when reality fails to make sense and I cannot endure this discomfort for very long. I therefore feel a compulsion to make it coherent as soon as possible.
* flippancy, sensationalism, a general lack of concern with accuracy - This is how old wives' tales get passed along, for example. Even systematically disproving them would be of no avail in stemming their spread.

On the other hand, there is the tendency to deconstruct the subject matter to its most basic parts and then to try to make sense of every one of them. This may seem more sophisticated than the first approach, since it is disciplined and thorough and grounded in the reality itself. The problem is that the matter we are trying to make sense of may slyly slip passed us while we are rigorously drilling into it. It would be like my being so curious about *time* that I pull apart a clock and examine every one of its gears. Now, I understand that clock entirely, from the ground up, but as a I wait in suspense before the irreducible gear, I find myself no closer to comprehending time than when I began. More realistically, people may try to make sense of their health by subjecting themselves to a never-ending series of tests, while the illness keeps evading their grasp and reemerging. The problem here is *not seeing the forest for the trees*.

## Zeitgeist - an example of the whole
Almost all statements that begin with "Gen Z is..." are hasty generalizations. And yet, there really is such a thing as Gen Z. There really is "society nowadays," even while most of our statements about it do not capture it. The media cult follows fads that fade as quickly as they rise and altogether lack import. Meanwhile, social researchers get lost in statistics, which is the wrong instrument for measuring the Zeitgeist (the *spirit* of the times). Even an individual's spirit cannot be measured in a questionnaire (he never feels that his recorded answers captured the nuances of his perspective), much less the spirit of the times and of billions of people. Scientific researchers believe they can explain the times through game theory or neural pathways or nutrition. Is there anybody out there who gets it, who sees the whole, who senses the spirit?

In 1988, Pope St. John Paul II wrote: 

> Science can purify religion from error and superstition; religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes. Each can draw the other into a wider world, a world in which both can flourish.[^99]

He strikes me as someone who *saw* something: where things stood, where they could end up. Or as Mother Teresa, understanding the hearts of people today so deeply, would say, “The most terrible poverty is loneliness, and the feeling of being unloved.”

## The science of zooming in, the art of zooming out
We must appreciate the scientific enterprise, inasmuch as it saved us from unbounded speculation and hasty generalizations. Whether we are involved in science itself or not, we should learn from it. Its patient, methodic, falsification-bounded crawl to the truth is something we can all learn from. The *science of zooming in* is about isolating variables, controlling for other factors, and rigorous testing. As John Paul II wrote above, Christians could learn a lot from this. Instead of making hasty generalizations about the origins and remedies of anxiety or about jealousy or shame, they should first carefully zoom in to the phenomena. If they did, they would almost immediately notice that these are each present in other animals as well, and they would be careful to build upon these animal foundations. (As it stands, many of the explanations out there are so lofty that they inadvertently ascribe a spiritual character to animals.) Zooming in requires the patience of small steps and the humility of following the evidence, often despite the urgent need for coherence.

A researcher may be knee-deep in a difficult problem when he is called away from his desk. Everyone knows that just getting up, stepping away, perhaps stepping outside, and physically seeing a wider view can provide fresh perspective on any problem. Sometimes a bit of music can make the world change. Life looks different with headphones on, like when you look at all the people flurrying about the airport but all you hear is Louis Armstrong singing "[What A Wonderful World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nGKqH26xlg)." Indeed, artists are especially gifted in capturing the Zeitgeist and other "wholes," typically through intuitive and pre-reflective genius. Their works help us scale the heights of Being, if but for a moment, and see the big picture. Beauty, nature, music, art -- these are all helpful for "zooming out" -- as are loved ones and children. They snap us out of a fanatical fixation that perhaps lost sight of the whole point a long time ago. Nothing zooms out more wondrously than daily contemplative prayer, through which the Holy Spirit gives us a share in the Mind of Christ and reveals to us the unfathomable depths of God.
