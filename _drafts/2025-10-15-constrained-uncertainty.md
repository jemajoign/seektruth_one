# 1. The Benefits of Control
The need for control is something most of us can relate with. Often people speak of control in negative terms because an almost compulsive need for control of situations can be overpowering and detrimental. Yet, control itself is not bad. In fact, it is the key to navigating, surviving, and thriving amid life's uncertainties. Let us take an obvious example to demonstrate this. When experts predict, with some degree of certainty, that a strong hurricane will make its way to your town, you assume control of the situation by boarding up your windows. In general, we take control to put up a resistance to potential threats. If you have a presentation coming up at work, and you feel nervous about it, the threat is doing poorly, appearing incompetent, or wasting people's time. You take control by preparing well for it, and this inevitably mitigates the risk of failure. The immune system is always prepared for threats. We have B cell and T cell receptors that can stand ready to identify more than 100,000,000 kinds of antigens (foreign substances). When these cells encounter a threat, the body rapidly produces antibodies to destroy it. Countless viruses and bacteria are continuously attempting to hijack our bodies, but the immune system usually maintains control.

For all these advantages of control, risk can only be mitigated, *never* eliminated. This is because the uncertainty of future events cannot be reduced indefinitely. As long as there is an unknown future, we cannot perfectly prepare for it. As we will uncover below, the failure to accept a necessary degree of risk turns into the pathological need for control. Before that, let us see how 20th century physicists and mathematicians gave us two completely different reasons to be certain that uncertainty is inevitable. 


# 2. The Certainty of Uncertainty
## 2.1 Chaos Theory
In the 1960s, a mathematician and meteorologist named Edward Lorenz discovered *chaos theory*. In contrast to the connotations of the name, chaos theory does not imply that the world is chaotic (i.e. without order). Rather, it means that infinitesimally small changes in the present can result in large changes in the future. Insofar as we cannot capture all the infinitesimal occurrences of the present, we cannot predict the future with certainty. Lorenz asks, "Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?"[^1] This notion is called *sensitive dependence on initial conditions*. The mathematical equations that model weather patterns (and, as we have since discovered, innumerable other complex systems) exhibit such sensitive dependence.

To wrap our head around what we mean by a chaotic system, the double pendulum is a great example. Thanks to the open source of work of Erik Neumann, you can try one out for yourself [here](https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html). In the screen recording below, you can see how to run a few simulations for yourself. You may try to keep the initial conditions the same or similar, but if you watch the path of the double pendulum, you will see that it is *completely* different in both cases. This is the idea of chaotic systems. The slightest variation in the beginning causes a significant or disproportionate change later on.

Henri PoincarÃ© was perhaps the first person to notice this phenomenon. Here is an except from his "Science and Method" written in 1914[^2]:
> If we knew exactly the laws of nature and the situation of the universe at the initial moment, we could predict exactly the situation of that same universe at a succeeding moment. But, even if it were the case that the natural laws had no longer any secret for us, we could still only know the initial situation *approximately*. If that enabled us to predict the succeeding situation *with the same approximation*, that is all we require, and we should say that the phenomenon had been predicted, that it is governed by laws. But it is not always so; it may happen that `small differences in the initial conditions produce very great ones in the final phenomena`. A small error in the former will produce an enormous error in the latter. Prediction becomes impossible, and we have the fortuitous phenomenon. 

> Our second example will be very much like our first, and we will borrow it from meteorology. Why have meteorologists such difficulty in predicting the weather with any certainty? Why is it that showers and even storms seem to come by chance, so that many people think it quite natural to pray for rain or fine weather, though they would consider it ridiculous to ask for an eclipse by prayer? We see that great disturbances are generally produced in regions where the atmosphere is in unstable equilibrium. The meteorologists see very well that the equilibrium is unstable, that a cyclone will be formed
somewhere, but exactly where they are not in a position to say; a tenth of a degree more or less at any given point, and the cyclone will burst here and not there, and extend its ravages over districts it would otherwise have spared. 

While chaos theory is a precise concept pertaining to deterministic, physical systems, it is a specific instance of a broader truth. Reality is infinitesimally complex, even while it exhibits comprehensible macro patterns and follows rules well suited to approximation. This infinitesimal complexity cannot be fathomed and so neither can certainty be attained about the future. To apply this notion to another field, think about close relationships. If one were to freeze time during an interaction of two close friends, the nuances of love, thought, perspective, feeling, thoughts about what the other person is thinking, circumstances, etc. are so complex and involved that they are effectively unfathomable. And yet, any one of these phenomena could result in a disproportionate result. The smallest and most imperceptible seed of doubt can grow into the end of a relationship just as much as the most fleeting moment of laughter can become the faithful commitment of 60 years. We cannot even wholly know ourselves in a given moment. Much less can we know others. Therefore, the future is inevitably uncertain, and its risks cannot be eliminated through control.

## 2.2 Quantum Uncertainty

Uncertainty at the quantum level rises to a radically new level. Whereas chaos theory practically necessitates uncertainty because of the finite limits of measurement, quantum theory suggests that uncertainty is an essential structure of reality. In the classical understanding, you can observe a particle and know its position precisely. The more precise your measuring rod, the more precisely you can know the particle's position. However, we have discovered that at the atomic scale, determining the precise position of a particle is impossible. In fact, it lacks a definite position. The most accurate way to characterize the position of an atom prior to measurement is by assigning probabilities that you would find the atom at each of its possible positions. So, for example, I could say that at this very moment there is a 49.99% chance of finding your atom between a and b, a 49.99% chance of finding it between b and c, and a small chance of finding it outside of a and c. There is *no way* to overcome this inherent uncertainty. It has nothing to do with our capacity for measurement or for prediction. The atom itself is not located at a specific position until it is measured.

If we pause and think about what this means, it is troubling. Typically, if you understand the parts of something and how they work together, you understand the whole. In this case, when we break down everything to its constituent parts (atoms, electrons, etc), we find that they lack specificity and definiteness. The answer to the simple question is particle p at position x results in a strange answer of both yes and no or perhaps neither. The same is true about several of its other properties such as energy level and momentum. But can a universe where answers to simple questions are both yes and no be comprehensible? Fortunately, the universe built entirely of indefinite blocks is somehow definite. I know exactly where my water bottle is, but I don't know where its atoms are. 

We should note one special characteristic of quantum uncertainty, namely that it is certain. The uncertainty is not unbounded, since we know that the position of any particle has definite possibilities with predetermined probabilities. For example, the electron of a hydrogen atom cannot be anywhere at random. Its position follows strict laws of probability. The graph below tells us exactly how far the electron can be from the nucleus of the atom, depending on its energy level.
![Electron positional probabilities]({{ site.media }}./electron_probabilities.jpg)[^3] 

This results in definite shapes of probable locations for where the electron would "appear" if its position was measured. The shapes look like this: 

![Hydrogen Density Plots]({{ site.media }}./Hydrogen_Density_Plots.png)[^4]

What does this picture mean? Precisely, it means if you measured the position of the electrons of millions of hydrogen atoms and plotted their positions together with the frequencies with which they appeared at those positions, you would end up with pictures like what you see above. Looking at these pictures, it starts to become clear how definite order can emerge from indefinite states. Even if the positions are completely uncertain and unpredictable (i.e. exhibiting true randomness), the uncertainty falls into a macro pattern. (In fact, something similar happens with [Lorenz attractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system#/media/File:Lorenz_attractor_in_Julia.gif) in chaos theory, though they are deterministic and not random.)

## 2.3 Containing Uncertainty
From the foregoing, we see that uncertainty is a certain and inescapable characteristic of the universe. The compulsive need to eliminate all risk is therefore maladaptive to the nature of reality (i.e. pathological). On the other hand, the more precisely we understand uncertainty *as uncertainty* of some definite kind, we constrain it within a macro pattern, *which can be utilized as something certain*. We rely on hydrogen atoms, with all their indomitable uncertainty, to act in definite ways and even bet our lives on it (as we do when we fly 30,000 feet above the earth in small tubes running on hydrocarbon fuel). One might call this an approximation or an averaging out of randomness. Regardless, uncertainty has contours that be discovered through careful observation and analysis. The wildness of uncertainty can become a tamed wildness.

# 3. Controlling People
One of the most scornful forms of control is the attempt to control other people. This is what is typically meant by "S/he is a controlling person." All of us can relate to the urge to control others. We may try to control how people think or feel about us. We may try to control the choices (or lack thereof) of our children. Many wise people have pointed out that what other people do is not in our power and that we must learn to accept it rather than to attempt to control it. The ancient stoics, the popular contemporary book "The Let Theory" by Mel Robbins, and Alfred Adler's separation of tasks all point us in the same direction: come to terms with the fact what other people choose to do is not within one's control. In that case, we should ask, what ever gave us the idea that it is possible to control another person? In other words, why do we even try?

Clearly, that other people are not in our control is an oversimplification, albeit a helpful one. Imagine if, as you were taking your children to school, you instructed your son not to taunt his sister for the remainder of the trip. Then, rather than merely noting whether your words were effective or not (i.e. whether you had control or not), you opted to take a more scientific approach. Each day, you came home and plotted how many seconds your son refrained from taunting his sister after you instructed him not to. You also included other variables like how many hours of sleep he got and the intensity of your tone. Perhaps you would end up with a graph like the hydrogen density plots above. Of course, such an experiment is fictional and even comical. Yet, from this mental exercises alone, we can be sure, that graph of this kind would show us one truth with certainty: we *do* have control over other people.

Of course, the control of others is always limited and, in some cases, negligibly small. This is no surprise, since every form control is limited insofar as uncertainty is an unconquerable feature of reality. Like the immune system, we can prepare for millions of eventualities and still find ourselves with only limited control of a new situation. There is no way for a parent to be sure which path a child will take, despite the best efforts. At yet, for all its limits, we cannot reasonably deny that the parent exercises some degree of control and that the outcomes likely follow a probability distribution. If they did not, parenting would be pointless. The same of course is true in all relationships in varying degrees and with special probability distributions of their own. 

## 3.1 The Need for Power
We can modify the previous parenting experiment. Instead of tracking one person's compliance to your instructions, we can track everyone's compliance. Moreover, we can make it recursive so that if person A has a 50% chance of complying with your instructions and person B has a 50% chance of complying with person A's instructions, person B can be said to have a 25% chance of complying with your instructions (indirectly). The resulting probability distribution, with all its own particular variables, will be a representation of your power.

One problem with such a model is that it ignores all who control you. For example, a traditional king was very powerful, except if he was a vassal or puppet (i.e. if he had to comply say 90% of the time with the larger empire). Clearly a vassal king does not possess control, even though many people follow his instructions. We would have to think of power, then, very roughly as how much you control minus how much you are controlled. This coincides with the common sense perception that powerful people can "do whatever they want." 

People seek after power even at great personal cost. For large part, this is because increased control of any kind helps mitigate risk and protect one from potential threats. Power makes a person feel secure and capable without the need to appease others (i.e. make concessions) for protection and support. Money is indeed a form of control and power, since people will do one's bidding in exchange for it. Hence, the compulsive need for wealth is not unlike the compulsive need for control. A person that no one listens to or cares about, a truly powerless and poor individual, has no way to mitigate risk. He is susceptible to every attack, whether of the elements or his fellow man. 

One may disagree that people pursue power or wealth to mitigate risk. They do it, it is supposed, to be able to do whatever they want and get whatever they want. The same may be said for everyone. Everyone wants to do what they want to do, this being a tautology. Everyone wants to get what they want. The problem is that there are obstacles and threats that get in the way. Power is that which minimizes the resistance posed by obstacles. Power is ability (*Î´ÏÎ½Î±Î¼Î¹Ï*, *potis*). Power is control. It does not mean merely being able break rules, laws, or social conventions. Power means being able to see the stars from above the atmosphere, being able to learn the piano from a maestro, being able to start a large nonprofit that transforms the lives of entire populations, being able to travel for months to experience other beautiful cultures, and doing whatever else your heart may desire. It is no surprise, then, that powerful people are happier. It was, however, a pleasant surprise to find at least one study that arrived at a similar conclusion as ours -- namely that power is desirable because it increases control and mitigates risk. In the authors' words, power makers people happier because it "activates proactive coping strategies," which are defined as "oneâs cognitive and behavioral efforts to control, resist, and mitigate the internal and external demands of stressful events."[^5]

## 3.2 The Paradoxes of Power
The previous section may seem like a Nietzschean ode to power. It is not. In fact, it is not a value judgement about the need for power but a simple and honest analysis of it. Now we must just as honestly acknowledge its limits.

### 3.2.1 Paradox of Love
If you had absolute power over another, which means that the other person necessarily and always does your bidding, you would forfeit what the chiefest cause for the greatest kind of happiness. You can never be loved by that person. For, if the other loves you, it is only because you want them to, and so you would actually just be loving yourself though the other person. This is captured well in the mythological notion that a genie can grant almost any wish, but he cannot make anyone love you. To make someone love you is a contradiction in terms. 

In leadership, love on a different but similar form. Many kings and queens, CEOs, presidents, politicians, billionaires, and religious leaders try to make others love them. And when they do, they somehow find that the praises are never enough. Indeed, nothing that is ingenuine can ever be enough. People show them appreciation merely to appease them and, somewhere within, they know this to be the case. Jesus warned his disciples about such people. He said, "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers" (Mark 12:38-40).

As we see, love cannot coexist with control. Love requires that we venture into a space that is characteristically outside of our control. It exposes us to risk and makes us vulnerable. This is why even the wealthiest people lose unimaginable sums of money in acrimonious divorces. These most powerful people who have everything locked down tightly, in the area of love, had nothing under control. They could not mitigate every risk in their relationship, insofar as it was truly a relationship of love. Later on, in their second and third marriages, they go in with many jaded concessions that all come at the expense of love. The paradox of love is that the greatest possible happiness in the world requires vulnerability to unhappiness, the relinquishment of control, and susceptibility to hurt.

### 3.2.2 Paradox of Leadership

Great leaders inspire others to greatness, collectively and personally. No one who is controlled by you can be inspired by you in the same respects.

If you inspire others, the probability that others will follow your instructions increases, and yet this is not control. If a person *chooses* to do it freely, if they are inspired, they are not being controlled by you but by themselves. Power (one's control *over* others minus the one's being controlled *by* others) shifts whenever you inspire others. Their power increases as yours decreases. Imagine a person who was genuinely loved by a great number of people. She is, for example, a mother but one who reverences the individuality and particular dignity of her children. She is a CEO but one who sees her employees as autonomous collaborators rather than as her servants.[^6] She is a wife but one who has no desire to control her husband. In all such cases, she relinquishes control and opts to inspire rather than coerce. Through gentleness (i.e. reverence concerning the otherness of others), she finds great fulfillment and even the greatest possible support. 

The art of being inspirational is to allow other people to freely follow your lead, which means that you will have to let them be free.


### 3.2.2 Paradox of Security
Power is about security. And yet, powerful people can be terribly insecure. The smallest criticism can send them into a rage, and challenges to their superiority are often met with vengeance. These explosive reactions nothing but symptoms of fear. Powerful people often live in the fear of losing their position.

Contrast such an insecure person who has it all with a figure like Paul, an apostle of Christ. In his letter to the Philippians, he wrote:
> I have learned, in whatever situation I am, to be content. I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. `In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret` of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. `I can do all things through him who strengthens me` (Phil 4:11-13).

The security obtained through control is paradoxically a fragile security. It is like a massive, protective structure made of glass. Those who find security apart from control have a firmer basis for their security than control. They do not need to eliminate risk and uncertainty. They can embrace it because there possess a mysterious certainty that underlies any uncertainty. This is faith, and it resolves the second paradox. Faith is the confidence that "for those who love God *all things* work together for good" (Rom 8:28). Faith is power without control.
