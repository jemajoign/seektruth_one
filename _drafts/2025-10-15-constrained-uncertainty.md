# 1. The Benefits of Control
The need for control is something most of us can relate with. Often people speak of control in negative terms because an almost compulsive need for control of situations can be overpowering and detrimental. Yet, control itself is not bad. In fact, it is the key to navigating, surviving, and thriving amid life's uncertainties. Let us take an obvious example to demonstrate this. When experts predict, with some degree of certainty, that a strong hurricane will make its way to your town, you assume control of the situation by boarding up your windows. In general, we take control to put up a resistance against potential threats. If you have a presentation coming up at work, and you feel nervous about it, the threat you fear is doing poorly, appearing incompetent, or wasting people's time. You take control by preparing well for it, and this successfully mitigates the risk of failure. The immune system is always prepared for threats. We have B cell and T cell receptors that can identify more than 100,000,000 kinds of antigens (foreign substances). As soon as these cells encounter a threat, the body initiates the process of eliminating it. Countless viruses and bacteria are constantly attempting to hijack our bodies, but the immune system is designed to maintain control.

There are two obstacles to control. The first was already mentioned: *uncertainty*. As much as we want to eliminate uncertainty, we can only mitigate its risks, *never* eliminate them. This is because the future can never be predicted perfectly. And as long as there is an unknown future, we cannot perfectly prepare for it. The failure to accept the necessary degree of risk can become pathological. People experience mysophobia (germophobia) when they cannot accept that the risk of germs can be mitigated but never eliminated.

A second obstacle to control is, what we may call, *recalcitrance*. Some situations will not be controlled. They will occur as they will regardless of our intentions. This feature of reality has been recognized since the Stoics and is captured in the popular serenity prayer: "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change..." Two examples close to the human heart are when people wish they could bring back their beloved dead and when people wish they could change the past. In most cases, however, the recalcitrance is not infinite. It may "kick back" (*re*: "back" and *calcitrare*: "to kick") but only so much. Put another way, many recalcitrant situations X do not appear in the absolute form "I cannot do X" but rather the conditional form "I cannot do X unless I do Y," where Y is something requiring effort. Even seemingly impossible feats can be conditionalized in this way. "I cannot live on the moon unless I..." As we will see below, people expend extraordinary effort to gain control over other people.

# 2. The Certainty of Uncertainty
The first obstacle of control, uncertainty, is much more pervasive and unrelenting that we once realized. 20th century physicists and mathematicians gave us two completely different reasons to be certain that uncertainty is inescapable.

## 2.1 Chaos Theory
In the 1960s, a mathematician and meteorologist named Edward Lorenz discovered *chaos theory*. In contrast to the connotations of the name, chaos theory does not imply that the world is chaotic (i.e. without order). Rather, it means that infinitesimally small changes in the present can result in large changes in the future. Insofar as we cannot capture all the infinitesimal occurrences of the present, we cannot predict the future with certainty. Lorenz asks, "Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?"[^1] This notion is called *sensitive dependence on initial conditions*. The mathematical equations that model weather patterns (and, as we have since discovered, innumerable other complex systems) exhibit such sensitive dependence.

To wrap our head around what we mean by a chaotic system, the double pendulum is a great example. Thanks to the open source of work of Erik Neumann, you can try one out for yourself [here](https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html). In the screen recordings below, you can see that I attempted to drop two pendulums in the exact same way (i.e. with approximately the same initial conditions). They both start off the same, as is typical in chaotic systems. But very soon, they go on completely different paths. The pendulum on the right makes several loops and after the first few seconds, they both never move in near-unison again. This is the idea of chaotic systems. The infinitesimally slightest variation in the beginning causes a significant and disproportionate change later on.

Henri Poincaré was perhaps the first person to notice this phenomenon. Here is an except from his "Science and Method" written in 1914[^2]:
> If we knew exactly the laws of nature and the situation of the universe at the initial moment, we could predict exactly the situation of that same universe at a succeeding moment. But, even if it were the case that the natural laws had no longer any secret for us, we could still only know the initial situation *approximately*. If that enabled us to predict the succeeding situation *with the same approximation*, that is all we require, and we should say that the phenomenon had been predicted, that it is governed by laws. But it is not always so; it may happen that `small differences in the initial conditions produce very great ones in the final phenomena`. A small error in the former will produce an enormous error in the latter. Prediction becomes impossible, and we have the fortuitous phenomenon. 

> Our second example will be very much like our first, and we will borrow it from meteorology. Why have meteorologists such difficulty in predicting the weather with any certainty? Why is it that showers and even storms seem to come by chance, so that many people think it quite natural to pray for rain or fine weather, though they would consider it ridiculous to ask for an eclipse by prayer? We see that great disturbances are generally produced in regions where the atmosphere is in unstable equilibrium. The meteorologists see very well that the equilibrium is unstable, that a cyclone will be formed
somewhere, but exactly where they are not in a position to say; a tenth of a degree more or less at any given point, and the cyclone will burst here and not there, and extend its ravages over districts it would otherwise have spared. 

While chaos theory is a precise concept pertaining to deterministic, physical systems, it is a specific instance of a broader truth. Reality is infinitesimally complex, even while it exhibits comprehensible macro patterns and follows rules well suited to approximation. This infinitesimal complexity cannot be fathomed and so neither can certainty be attained about the future. To apply this notion to another field, think about close relationships. If one were to freeze time during an interaction of two close friends, the nuances of love, thought, perspective, feeling, thoughts about what the other person is thinking, circumstances, etc. are so complex and involved that they are effectively unfathomable. And yet, any one of these phenomena could result in a disproportionate result. The smallest and most imperceptible seed of doubt can grow into the end of a relationship just as much as the most fleeting moment of laughter can become the faithful commitment of 60 years. We cannot even wholly know ourselves in a given moment. Much less can we know others. Therefore, the future is inevitably uncertain, and its risks cannot be eliminated through control.

## 2.2 Quantum Uncertainty

Uncertainty at the quantum level rises to a radically new level. Whereas chaos theory practically necessitates uncertainty because of the finite limits of measurement, quantum theory suggests that uncertainty is an essential structure of reality. In the classical understanding, you can observe a particle and know its position precisely. The more precise your measuring rod, the more precisely you can know the particle's position. However, we have discovered that at the atomic scale, determining the precise position of a particle is impossible. In fact, it lacks a definite position. The most accurate way to characterize the position of an atom prior to measurement is by assigning probabilities that you would find the atom at each of its possible positions. So, for example, I could say that at this very moment there is a 49.99% chance of finding your atom between a and b, a 49.99% chance of finding it between b and c, and a small chance of finding it outside of a and c. There is *no way* to overcome this inherent uncertainty. It has nothing to do with our capacity for measurement or for prediction. The atom itself is not located at a specific position until it is measured.

If we pause and think about what this means, it is troubling. Typically, if you understand the parts of something and how they work together, you understand the whole. In this case, when we break down everything to its constituent parts (atoms, electrons, etc), we find that they lack specificity and definiteness. The answer to the simple question is particle p at position x results in a strange answer of both yes and no or perhaps neither. The same is true about several of its other properties such as energy level and momentum. But can a universe where answers to simple questions are both yes and no be comprehensible? Fortunately, the universe built entirely of indefinite blocks is somehow definite. I know exactly where my water bottle is, but I don't know where its atoms are. 

We should note one special characteristic of quantum uncertainty, namely that it is certain. The uncertainty is not unbounded, since we know that the position of any particle has definite possibilities with predetermined probabilities. For example, the electron of a hydrogen atom cannot be anywhere at random. Its position follows strict laws of probability. The graph below tells us exactly how far the electron can be from the nucleus of the atom, depending on its energy level.
![Electron positional probabilities]({{ site.media }}./electron_probabilities.jpg)[^3] 

This results in definite shapes of probable locations for where the electron would "appear" if its position was measured. The shapes look like this: 

![Hydrogen Density Plots]({{ site.media }}./Hydrogen_Density_Plots.png)[^4]

What does this picture mean? Precisely, it means if you measured the position of the electrons of millions of hydrogen atoms and plotted their positions together with the frequencies with which they appeared at those positions, you would end up with pictures like what you see above. Looking at these pictures, it starts to become clear how definite order can emerge from indefinite states. Even if the positions are completely uncertain and unpredictable (i.e. exhibiting true randomness), the uncertainty falls into a macro pattern. (In fact, something similar happens with [Lorenz attractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system#/media/File:Lorenz_attractor_in_Julia.gif) in chaos theory, though they are deterministic and not random.)

## 2.3 Containing Uncertainty
From the foregoing, we see that uncertainty is a certain and inescapable characteristic of the universe. The compulsive need to eliminate all risk is therefore maladaptive to reality (i.e. tending towards pathology). On the other hand, the more precisely we understand uncertainty *as uncertainty* of some definite kind, we constrain it within a macro pattern, *which can be utilized as something certain*. We rely on hydrogen atoms, with all their indomitable uncertainty, to act in definite ways and even bet our lives on it when we fly 40,000 feet above the earth in small tubes running on hydrocarbons. The consistent behavior might be an approximation or an averaging out of its randomness. Regardless, uncertainty has contours that be discovered through careful observation and analysis. The wildness of uncertainty can become a tamed wildness.

# 3. Controlling People
One of the most scornful forms of control is the attempt to control other people. This is what is typically meant by "S/he is a controlling person." All of us can relate to the urge to control others. We may try to control how people think or feel about us. We may try to control the choices (or lack thereof) of our children. Many wise people have pointed out that what other people do is not in our power and that we must learn to accept it rather than to attempt to control it. The ancient stoics, the popular contemporary book "The Let Theory" by Mel Robbins, and Alfred Adler's separation of tasks all point us in the same direction: come to terms with the fact what other people choose to do is not within our control. In that case, we should ask, what ever gave us the idea that it is possible to control another person in the first place? If it was impossible, why would we even try?

Clearly, that other people are not in our control is an oversimplification, albeit a helpful one. Imagine if, as you were taking your children to school, you instructed your son not to taunt his sister for the remainder of the trip. Rather than merely noting whether your words were effective or not (i.e. whether you had control or not), suppose you opted to take a more scientific approach. Each day, you came home and plotted how many seconds your son refrained from taunting his sister after you instructed him not to. You also included other variables like how many hours of sleep he got and the intensity of your tone. Perhaps you would end up with a graph like the hydrogen density plots above. Such an experiment is of course fictional and even comical. Yet, from this mental exercises alone, we can be sure that a graph of this kind would show us something interesting: we *do* have control over other people.

The control of others is always limited and, in some cases, negligibly small. This is no surprise, since every form control is limited insofar as uncertainty is an unconquerable feature of reality. There is no way for a mother to be sure which path her child will take, despite her best efforts. And yet, for all its limits, we cannot reasonably deny that the mother exercises some degree of control over her child and that the outcomes of her parenting likely follow a probability distribution. If they did not and the outcomes were as good as random, parenting would be pointless. The same of course is true in all relationships in varying degrees and with special probability distributions of their own. 

## 3.1 The Need for Power
We can modify the previous parenting experiment. Instead of tracking just your child's compliance to your instructions, you could track everyone's compliance. Moreover, you could make it recursive so that if person A has a 50% chance of complying with your instructions and person B has a 50% chance of complying with person A's instructions, person B can be said to have a 25% chance of complying with your instructions indirectly. This imaginary probability distribution, with all its own particular variables, is a representation of your power.

To make the model complete, we must factor in the extent to which you yourself are controlled. For example, a traditional king was very powerful, except when he was a vassal or puppet (i.e. if he had to comply say 90% of the time with the larger empire). Even though many people follow his instructions, a vassal king is not powerful. We would have to think of your power, then, very roughly as how much you control others minus how much you are controlled by others. An inordinately powerful person is one who can tell anyone what to do and they will do it, while no one dares tell him what to do. This description coincides with the common sense perception that powerful people can "do whatever they want." 

People seek after power even at great personal cost. This is because increased control over others helps mitigate the risks posed by uncertainty and provides greater combined effort to overcome recalcitrance (as defined above). Power makes a person feel secure and capable without the need to appease others (i.e. without making concessions) for protection and support. A person that no one listens to or cares about, a truly powerless individual, has very little opportunity to mitigate risk. He is susceptible to all attacks that could have been prevented through the support of others, including illness (since medical treatment requires the services of others). Evidently, money is a form of power, since people will do one's bidding in exchange for it, even providing medical care.

The assumption that people pursue power at great personal cost to mitigate risk and overcome obstacles may seem doubtful. It is often supposed that people pursue power to be able to do whatever they want and get whatever they want. This is true, but the same may be said for everyone. Everyone wants to do what they want to do -- this is a tautology. Everyone wants to get what they want, by definition. The problem is that there are obstacles and threats that get in the way. Power minimizes the resistance posed by obstacles. Power is ability (*δύναμις*, *potis*) through control of others. It does not mean merely being able to break rules, laws, or social conventions. It means being able to see the stars from above the atmosphere, to learn the piano from a maestro, to start a large nonprofit that transforms the lives of entire populations, to travel for months to learn about beautiful cultures, and doing whatever else one's heart may desire. It is no surprise, then, that powerful people are happier. Moreover, at least one study demonstrated a similar conclusion as ours -- namely that power is desirable because it increases control and mitigates risk. In the authors' words, power makers people happier because it "activates proactive coping strategies," which are defined as "one’s cognitive and behavioral efforts to control, resist, and mitigate the internal and external demands of stressful events."[^5]

Though all people want what they want, only some people seek power to obtain them. There is a trade-off in seeking power, which is explored below.

## 3.2 The Paradoxes of Power

### 3.2.1 Love and Power
By definition, if you have absolute control over others, they will follow all your instructions. Does this mean that you can obtain anything from them? Specifically, could you be loved by them?  Even assuming this was possible and that a person you controlled loved you, they would only be following your instructions in doing so. When you instruct someone to love and they love you, you are merely loving yourself. In this way, you forfeit the greatest happiness of all and the fulfillment of the greatest human desire, which is to be loved for who you are. This paradox is captured well in the mythological notion that a genie can grant almost any wish that your heart may desire, but he cannot grant what your heart most desires, which is that someone would love you. The genie is helpless here because to make someone love you would be a contradiction in terms. 

In the former case, we were thinking of love in the sense of an intimate relationship. In leadership, love takes on a different form but follows similar rules. Many kings and queens, CEOs, presidents, politicians, billionaires, and religious leaders try to make others love them through their power. In doing so, they are merely loving themselves. And when they do, the praises are never enough. After all, nothing that is ingenuine can ever be enough. People show them appreciation merely to appease them and, somewhere within, they know this to be the case. Jesus warned his disciples about such people. He said, "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers" (Mark 12:38-40).

Love cannot coexist with control. Love requires that we venture into a space that is characteristically outside of our control. It exposes us to risk and makes us vulnerable. This is why even the wealthiest people lose unimaginable sums of money in acrimonious divorces. These most powerful people of the world who had everything securely fastened, in the area of love, had nothing under control. When it came to their relationship, they did not mitigate every risk, because their relationship was one of love. In their second and third marriages, perhaps, they may go in with all manner of legal protections proportionate to their disenchantment and inability for love. The first paradox of power is that it betrays love, which offers the greatest possible happiness in the world.

### 3.2.2 Leadership and Power

If you are someone who inspires others, there is a high probability that others will follow your instructions, and yet this is not control. If a person *chooses* to do something freely (i.e., if they are inspired), they are not being controlled by you but by themselves. Power (one's control over others minus one's being controlled by others) shifts whenever you inspire someone. The other person's power increases as yours decreases. Imagine a person who was genuinely loved by a great number of people. She is, for example, a mother but one who reverences the individuality and particular dignity of her children. She is a CEO but one who sees her employees as autonomous collaborators rather than as her servants.[^6] She is a wife but one who has no desire to control her husband but only to allow him to flourish in his own right. In all such cases, she relinquishes control and opts to inspire rather than coerce. Through gentleness (i.e. reverence concerning the otherness of others), she finds great fulfillment and even the greatest possible support. People stand by her but only because they want to.

When you control others, they cannot be inspired by you. As such, the second paradox of power is that you cannot become a great leader until you let go of power, enable others to follow their genuine aspirations, and then hope for the best possible outcome. This is a vast topic that must be developed further elsewhere.


### 3.2.3 Security and Power
Powerful people often carry an air of indestructible confidence. It is strange therefore, that with many of them, the smallest criticism can send them into a rage. Slight challenges to their sense of superiority can be met with vengeful scheming. Such explosive reactions are obviously symptoms of acute fear. The third paradox of power is that power makes people insecure about losing their power.

The security obtained through control is evidently a fragile security and not a *secure security*. It is like a massive, protective structure made of glass. On the other hand, those who find security apart from control have a firmer basis for it. They do not live in fear of uncertainty. They can embrace uncertainty because they possess a mysterious certainty that underlies all uncertainty. This certainty is called faith, and we can see it in plain sight in a figure like Paul, the apostle of Christ. In his letter to the Philippians, he wrote:
> I have learned, in whatever situation I am, to be content. I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. `In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret` of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. `I can do all things through him who strengthens me` (Phil 4:11-13).

Faith, in the Christian sense of the word, means entrusting oneself to God through Christ. On this basis, Paul finds that he "can do all," which is a *powerful* stance, though it is not a controlling one. Using "powerful" in this way would require us to relocate the signification of "power" to its more primitive meaning as *ability*. For the purposes of this essay, we refrain from doing so and maintain the more common usage pertaining to control over others. Put simply, therefore, Paul's faith gives him extraordinary ability but without requiring control. He entrusts himself to "him who strengthens [him]" and who "works all things for good for those who love God" (Rom 8:28).

# 4. Conclusion
The desire for control is one of the most natural responses to the inherent uncertainty and recalcitrance of the universe. Even when this desire is heeded in non-pathological ways, it results in significant trade-offs of higher goods. In particular, we explored the forfeitures of love, inspirational leadership, and secure security. These transcendent goods lie at the intersection of matter and spirit and cannot be wholly explained by material causality. When people seek them out, they relinquish control, never to fall back into the primordial chaos from which control saves us, but to ascend to an even higher order of certainty that governs the destiny of mankind. Such people are the ones that carry the world forward.
