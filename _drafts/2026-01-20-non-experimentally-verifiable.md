## Math, Physics, and History
In mathematics (or formal sciences in general), it is possible to *prove* theorems. Given a set of axioms, you can draw conclusions from them that will thereafter be known with certainty. To take an extremely simple example and silly example, we can show that if you have an odd number of ducks, say $N$ ducks, and they each have $N$ ducklings, the total number of ducklings ($N \times N$) will also be odd.

Positive odd numbers are 1, 3, 5,... We notice that this is the same $2 \times 0 + 1, 2 \times 1 + 1, 2 \times 2 + 1$,... In other words, an odd number $N$ is $2k+1$ for some positive integer $k$. (Put another way, every positive odd number is one greater than 0 or some positive even number.) Since we know that $N=2k+1$, we know that we have $2k+1$ ducks and each duck has $2k+1$ ducklings. $N \times N = (2k+1) \times (2k+1) = (2k \times 2k) + (2k \times 1) + (1 \times 2k) + (1 \times 1) = 4k^2 + 4k + 1$. Thw two terms on the left happen to both be divisible by two. If we pull the 2 out, we get $2(2k^2 + 2k)+1$. Now, the factor in parenthesis, involving the multiplication and addition of integers, must also be an integer. Suppose we call it $m$, where $m = 2k^2 + 2k$. Now our number of ducks is $N \times N = 2m+1$. Notice that this is the very definition of an odd number (i.e. it is one greater than the even number $2m$). Therefore, we know with *certainty* that, given the contrived scenario presented above, there will be an odd number of ducklings.

This kind of provable certainty is only possible in the formal sciences. This is because the theorem that is being proved is in fact a restatement of the original axioms in different words. It is just a matter of thinking through what is already implied at the forefront. When we talk about having an odd number of odd numbers, it already implies that there will be an odd number of $+1$'s. When you try to divide an odd number in two, there will always be one outlier, like so.
