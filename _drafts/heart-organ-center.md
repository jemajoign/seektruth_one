## The heart in pre-modernity
The heart is the organ that circulates oxygen-loaded blood cells between the lungs and the other cells of the body. As William Harvey (d. 1657) first observed, the heart is literally a pump, an idea popularized by Descartes. Why has this very mechanical organ, of all the human organs, been used to represent the spiritual depths of the human person? 

Our ancestors saw the heart as the seat of emotions, intelligence, and the soul. Today, we comfortably employ what they have written about the heart as though they were speaking metaphorically. Take a look at what Aristotle writes:
    These writers see that certain of the senses are located in the head, and are unable to discern the reason for this; they see also that the brain is the most peculiar of all the animal organs; and out of these facts they form an argument, by which they link sensation and brain together. It has, however, already been clearly set forth in the treatise on Sensation, that it is the region of the heart that constitutes the sensory centre.[^99]

It is not just Aristotle, but most thinkers down through the ages and across disparate, saw the heart as the spiritual and vital center of the human being. Other thinkers, such as Pythagoras and Plato, thought somewhat differently, but they were the exception rather than the rule. The Egyptian Papyrus of Ani (1250 BC), taking us back further than these Greek philosophers, describes the "weighing of the heart" as the form of final judgment.

The [text](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA10470-3) that accompanies it: 
    Thoth's declaration to the Great Ennead in the presence of Osiris : "Hear ye in very truth this statement; I have judged the heart of this Osiris [i.e., Ani], his soul standing as witness for him. His deeds are true upon the great balance; no evil has been found in him ... Great Ennead's proclamation to Thoth : "This utterance of yours is true. The Osiris, king's scribe Ani, justified, is without evil. We have nothing to accuse him of...

The Chinese believed that [Xin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xin_(heart-mind) (the heart) was the source of cognition. The same was true in India ([hṛdaya](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%AF#Sanskrit:_heart:~:text=%5Bedit%5D-,%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%91%E0%A4%AF%20%E2%80%A2%20(h%E1%B9%9B%CC%81daya),-stem%2C%C2%A0n)). While the Hebrew word "leb" does not point directly to a specific organ, it generally follows suit by highlight the 'heart area in general'. In the Hebrew Scriptures, "Often lēḇ serves in the absence of a Hebrew word for 'breast' or 'chest'... The lēḇ functions in all dimensions of human existence and is used as a term for all the aspects of a person: vital, affective, noetic, and voluntative."[^99]

## Why the heart?
It is amazing how quickly your heart speeds up when you meet a threat. Your heart leaps before you even *realize* that you are in danger. And this is what makes emotions so fascinating. They are "multidimensional" reactions to the environment or automatic thoughts that often precede conscious awareness. One of those "dimensions" is your heart rate, which can change without any awareness. In fact, your heart rate can clue you in to how you are feeling. Someone says something that gets you upset, your heart rate soars, and *then* you notice that your heart is pounding and that you are upset. Pulse is an easily noticeable signal from the subconscious about how we are feeling. No wonder people use the expression, "I want to feel the pulse of the situation." Perhaps this is why the heart became associated with the seat of our emotions and deepest feelings. You often come to know how you are feeling by paying attention your heart.

Of course, there are many other "dimensions" to emotional reactions than heart activity. Facial expression, for example, is a powerful indicator of emotion. However, facial expressions are equally the product of the autonomic nervous system (i.e. unconscious) and the somatic nervous system (i.e. volitional). I may smile, even to myself, though I do not feel happy. That is not possible with the heart, which is why polygraphs are quite effective, even on people who can keep a straight face while telling a lie. If a person is in love, even if she does not want to be in love, her heart remains honest with her. If a person is excited, his heart beats faster, even if he tries to appear unaffected.

Clearly then, the heart stands out among all the organs as the most representative and truthful expression of what one is feeling. It is understandable therefore how it was supposed to be origin or seat of emotion, morality, decisions, and even thought. 

## The fine resolution of the heart

Is your heart pounding like a drum? Is it flowing easily up and down with your breathing? This tells you whether your heart is more so under the reigns of your sympathetic nervous system (SNS - i.e. fight and flight) or your parasympathetic nervous system (PNS - i.e. rest and digest). But what is even more incredible is the fine-grained resolution of these systems in their control of the heart. The SNS does not just kick in when you are under threat but *every time you breathe in*. The PNS sends a steady "take it easy" signal to your heart's internal "pacemaker". Every time you breathe in, however, receptors in your lungs notify the brain stem, which inhibits this calming effect of the PNS. What results is a mild fight or flight response, triggering the faster pumping of blood, while you are breathing in. Breathing out has the opposite effect.

An electrocardiogram records the electrical signals of the heart's "pacemaker". The spikes in the following image show the main pumping action that we refer to as our heart beat or pulse.

![ECG]({{ site.media }}./ecg.png)

Looking closely, you will see that the spacing between the peeks varies. The time between them is less during inhalation and greater during exhalation. If you assign a time to each heart beat based on the time lapsed since the last heart beat, you will see a curve that moves up and down quite nicely like this.

![RR Intervals]({{ site.media }}./rr_intervals.png)

In this graph, the peeks are when the heart is pumping most slowly. It usually occurs at some point while breathing out or while holding one's breath. However, after a few seconds of either, the SNP will kick back in due to subtle asphyxiation. If you follow a breathing pattern such as the Weil method (also called "4-7-8"; inhale for 4 seconds/counts, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds), you can notice the asphyxiation activation occur after holding your breath for a few seconds. Interestingly, exhaling can once again activate the PNS. In our way of plotting the durations, this may appear as a dip in the middle of a rising heart rate.

*Note: the red line is a repeating, fitted curve to show the remarkable repetitiveness of the pattern that can be attained through the observance of a breathing pattern. This particular curve is approximately $r(n)=r_0-(2s/3)sin(2\pi*n/P)+s*cos(4\pi*n/P)$*, where $r_0$ is the mean interval between heart beats, $P$ is the number of heart beats per respiratory cycle, $s$ is some scaling factor (in this case about 100), and $n$ is the variable representing the beat number (not time).
