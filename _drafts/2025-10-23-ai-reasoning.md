## Is the AI question new?    
One of the most pivotal questions today is whether AI will be able to replace human beings. To begin with, there is no doubt that many human-occupied positions are already being replaced by AI. This does not answer the question but nuances it. It tells us that certain human tasks can be performed by AI. That machines can complete our tasks should not be surprising to us. It was only recently that we discovered this fact concretely and to a epoch-making degree during the industrial era. The ordinary tasks being performed by human beings. The first *programmable* loom, the [Jacquard machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine) was made 225 years ago! Look at this exquisite, silk portrait of its maker, woven by the Jacquard machine in 1837.

As incredible as the Jacquard machine was for 1801, it is a long way from where we are today. Could anyone have imagined, at that time, that we would be asking this pivotal question today of whether machines can replace us? In fact, *that* question was asked and answered a full 160 years before the Jacquard machine by the philosopher and mathematician René Descartes in 1637. His answer to the question, with all the excusable limitations of being written almost 400 years ago, proves surprisingly helpful in answering our question.

> ...although such machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us, they would, without doubt, fail in certain others from which it could be discovered that they did not act from knowledge, but solely from the disposition of their organs: for while reason is an universal instrument that is alike available on every occasion, these organs, on the contrary, need a particular arrangement for each particular action; whence it must be morally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient to enable it to act in all the occurrences of life, in the way in which our reason enables us to act.[^1]

This answer is strikingly prescient. He even wrote: "For we may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that it emits vocables, and even that it emits some correspondent to the action upon it of external objects which cause a change in its organs; for example, if touched in a particular place it may demand what we wish to say to it; if in another it may cry out that it is hurt, and such like." Yes, in 1637, Descartes foresaw a machine that could tell us using words if it was hurt!

However, there was more than just predictive prowess here. Descartes had insight into the fundamental distinction between machines and humans. He believed that machines, no matter how complex, "need a particular arrangement for each particular action." Whether the Jacquard machine or a Large Language Model, this appears to be true. The particular arrangement has been growing exponentially complex so that it will eventually become responsive to nearly every scenario. Such rapid complexification would not have been possible without important discoveries along the way, such as the use of electrons and transistors for processing at rapid speeds, and of course the discovery of artificial neural networks. The mathematical model that we call a neural network was proposed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943 and then first constructed by Marvin Minsky in 1951. The first trainable neural network, called the "Perceptron," was developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. A trainable neural network is an adaptive and highly nuanced "particular arrangement" of weighted connections between nodes. 

## Why does AI work better than manually created machines?
Using a system of pulleys and ropes (i.e. a particular arrangement), one could imagine creating a machine that responds to a variety of situations and completes certain tasks better than human beings. The difference with artificial intelligence lies in the trainable neural network. Rather than be given the perfect, particular arrangement, it is able to adjust the innumerable connections between a given stimulus and the provided response so as it minimize the difference between the provided response and the expected response (i.e. the error). Here, one could imagine someone continuously tweaking the system of pulleys and ropes until the machines does it is expected to. Doing this at the speed of electronic computation and with the spatial compactness of electrons, the machine can become extraordinarily capable, flexible, and fast.

## Can AI think?
Now we get to the heart of the question.

## Can humans think?
Now we *really* get to the heart of the question
