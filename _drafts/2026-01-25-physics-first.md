Beginning with Aristotle, metaphysics was classically considered the first philosophy or the first science. Aristotle himself never used the word "metaphysics" but the field of study he called "first philosophy" and which concerned the study of "being *qua* being" (i.e. being insofar as it is being) was later known as metaphysics. Aristotle lived in a time and place, rare in world history, where both rigorous observation and overarching philosophy came together. He believed that each particular science studied being insofar as it was some particular kind of being. Biology studied living beings, physics studies natural/changeable bodies, ethics studied human action, etc. But metaphysics studied that which belongs to any being insofar it "is," regardless of *what* it is -- being *qua* being.

Today, hardly anyone looks to metaphysics for an ultimate explanation of reality. If anything, we look to physics. This is because among the natural sciences, only physics can seeks explanations that pertain to every particle and force in the cosmos. We know of four fundamental forces: gravitational force, electromagnetic force, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force. Moreover, it appears that matter (i.e. anything with mass) is a particular manifestation of energy and matter can emerge from and return to energy randomly (see [Quantum Fluctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation)). The electromagnetic properties of atoms allow them to bond with other atoms in particular ways, giving rise to chemistry. The various chemically-bonded molecules give rise to biology, which gives rise to neuroscience and psychology, which gives rise to sociology, and so on.

Aristotle's primitive physics was wrong in a great number of ways. And though his metaphysics is, in a sense, built upon the observations from his secondary sciences, it remains surprisingly unscathed even by the discoveries of quantum mechanics or relativity, for example.
