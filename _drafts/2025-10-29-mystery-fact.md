Certain prominent scientists today scoff at what they consider the silly beliefs of prior generations and pious people around the world: beliefs in God, angels, the spiritual soul, life after death, and immaterial reality. It is taken for granted that these cannot be real and then they speculate as to why so many do believe and have believed in them. Any honest inquiry into the human experience of the transcendent must begin with this very *fact*: humans experience the transcendent (what shall be called mystery). We are not asking whether transcendent, immaterial, and unfathomable mystery *is* or not. Mystery is a given, which is why we must ask about it in the first place. What we are asking about it is whether this mystery which *is* *is real*.

For example, a person experienced God calling them to action in prayer. Then they doubt whether the call was *real* or whether they were making it up. This brings us to a difficult problem because it implies that something which *is* may not be *real*. Put another way, all that *is*, we could call phenomena. Some of the phenomena is also real. Now the question is what differentiates the real phenomena from the unreal.

We could say that it is sensible (by us and others). This is problematic because there are unsensible realities that affect the sensible world. Even if it was possible to sense invisible matter or energy, i.e. if we had superhuman senses, we still have a problem. The quantum wave function determines the probability of a particle's position. This wave function could not be detected even by superhuman senses. It even involves the imaginary number $i$. Yet, it accurately describes reality. The wave functions of two particles can even interfere with each other to produce different results. Therefore, at best we can say that something is real if it has measurable effects. This is of course an absurd definition because it is backwards. Something is not real because it can be measured; rather, something can be measured because it is real (i.e. because there is some real thing to measure).

What then about an idea? An idea can and does have measurable effects. We can trace the effects of an idea, such as communism or freedom of speech, through time and space. They make monumental changes in the course of history. An idea certain *is*. Is it real?

One of the brilliant contributions of the phenomenologists was that they did not discriminate against arbitrary classes of phenomena. Adolf Reinach, for example, observed that *promises* were just as real in the world of entities as trees or houses. They had specific properties, which could be studied. Indeed, he studied them extensively. He noted that every promise has the same structure. It involves the content of the promise (i.e. what was promised), the person(s) who made the promise (the obliged party), and the person(s) to whom the promise was made (the claim holder). The one who made the promise was not free to revoke the promise but only to break it or fulfill it. The claim holder, on the other hand, could release the obliged party from the obligation at any time. These are very particular characteristics, such as the characteristics one may abstract from some type of mineral or animal. It seems that we know it is real because it is both phenomenal (i.e. an object of consciousness) and verifiable by cross-examination by others or by corresponding in some other way to external reality. This latter point differentiates the real from hallucination. For example, if someone received a vision to construct a key
